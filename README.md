## App Description
Our application uses a small database that stores a user's bookmarked flights that they searched for and allows it to be retrieved.

## API 
We query the Skyscanner API with the origin, destination, date, and number of tickets to see the best flights for those parameters. API Link : https://rapidapi.com/3b-data-3b-data-default/api/skyscanner44/details
